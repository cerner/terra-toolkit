# webpack-config-terra Upgrade Guide

## Changes from @cerner/webpack-config-terra 2 to @cerner/webpack-config-terra 3

### Updated Webpack-Dev-Server from version 3 to verison 4

Webpack-dev-server has been updated to the latest version 4.x. This update will fix hot reloading issue on development mode which stopped working after upgrading Webpack to verison 5.

### Breaking Changes
Webpack-dev-server v3 will not work with webpack-config-terra  v3. The webpack-dev-server has replaced the configuration options ( listed below ) in v4, These changes will cause webpack-dev-server v3 configurations to fail with webpack-config-terra v3.
- `inline` has been removed without replacement in webpack-dev-server v4.
- `stats`, `index` and `publicPath` has been moved to `devMiddleware` option.

Updating webpack-config-terra to v3 would require consuming projects to update webpack-dev-server to v4 in their local dependencies.
```diff
  "devDependencies": {
-   "webpack-dev-server": "^3.x.x"
+   "webpack-dev-server": "^4.7.2"
  }
```
