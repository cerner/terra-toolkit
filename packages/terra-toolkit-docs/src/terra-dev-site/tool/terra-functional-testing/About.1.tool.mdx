# Terra Functional Testing

The terra-functional-testing library is a utility for developing automation tests. The library extends [WebdriverIO](https://v6.webdriver.io/) to facilitate automating accessibility and functional testing for Terra projects.

## System Requirements

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) Install at least v10.24.0. Due to requirements of fibers used within the project install no greater than lts/erbium (v12).
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) Install docker. Docker is used to setup and run tests in a containerized environment.

We strongly recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for installing node versions.

## Installation

Install @cerner/terra-functional-testing and @cerner/terra-cli as development dependencies with npm:

```
npm install --save-dev @cerner/terra-functional-testing @cerner/terra-cli
```

## Usage

A test runner is provided for local development. The test runner is invoked via the [terra-cli](/dev_tools/cerner-terra-toolkit-docs/terra-cli/about).

package.json
```json
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio"
}
```

### Options

| Option                           | Type    | Default                                          | Description                                                                                                                               |

The following example will run the test suite a total of four times. Once for each permutation of the specified locales and form factors.

```json
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --locales en fr --formFactors tiny huge"
}
```

## Browser Capabilities

The following browsers are supported:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Internet Explorer

Chrome is enabled by default when running locally against the docker container.

To target a list of browsers that are different than the default use the `browsers` cli option:

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

  Internet Explorer can only be enabled when running against a remote selenium grid. Internet Explorer is not available within the docker container.

</Notice>

```json
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --browsers firefox"
}
```

To run against a remote selenium grid:

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

  Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer are all enabled by default when running against a remote selenium grid.

</Notice>

```json
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --gridUrl grid.test.example.com"
}
```

## Form Factors

Tests can be executed in the following form factors:

| Size     | Width | Height |
|----------|-------|--------|
| tiny     | 470   | 768    |
| small    | 622   | 768    |
| medium   | 838   | 768    |
| large    | 1020  | 768    |
| huge     | 1300  | 768    |
| enormous | 1500  | 768    |

To specify a list of form factors use the cli option:

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

  If no form factor is specified all tests will be run against the huge form factor.

</Notice>

```json
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --formFactors tiny small enormous"
}
```

## Configuration

The test runner ships with a default [wdio.conf.js](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit/blob/main/packages/terra-functional-testing/src/config/wdio.conf.js). Options can be configured by extending the default configuration file.

To extend the default configuration create a `wdio.conf.js` file at the root of your project and apply the desired options.

wdio.conf.js
```js
const { config } = require('@cerner/terra-functional-testing');

// Stop the test run if there is a test failure.
config.bail = 1;

exports.config = config;
```

## Service Options

Service options are configurable by extending the wdio.conf.js file. These options are applied for every test run.

### selector

Specifies the default element to be captured when taking a screenshot.

Type: `string`

Required: `false`

Default: `[data-terra-test-content] *:first-child`

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="4">

  This selector is used as the default screenshot selector for Terra.validates.element and Terra.validates.screenshot.

</Notice>

```js
const { config } = require('@cerner/terra-functional-testing');

config.serviceOptions = {
  selector: '#root',
};

exports.config = config;
```

### seleniumVersion

Specifies the [docker selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/tree/selenium-3) version used within the docker container.

Type: `string`

Required: `false`

Default: `3.14.0-helium`

<Notice variant="caution" ariaLevel="4">

  The selenium version is only applied when running tests against a docker container. This option does not change the version on a remote selenium grid. Keep this in mind if your tests run against a remote selenium grid on a CI system.

</Notice>

```js
const { config } = require('@cerner/terra-functional-testing');

config.serviceOptions = {
  seleniumVersion: '3.141.59-20210311',
};

exports.config = config;
```

## Test Utilities

Test utilities are available to help write tests. These utilities are accessed using the `Terra` global object.

### Describe Helpers

The describe helpers are an alias for the top level `describe` block used within spec files. The describe helpers provide useful features for limiting a set of tests to specific form factors, locales, and themes.

#### Terra.describeViewports

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="5">

  We recommended using Terra.describeTests instead of Terra.describeViewports. The same features in Terra.describeViewports can be achieved with Terra.describeTests.

</Notice>

The `Terra.describeViewports` utility defines a list of form factors the tests are enabled for. By default, all tests will be run against each provided viewport. If a form factor is specified via the cli the describe viewpoint helper works as a filter and only allows the tests to execute if they match the current form factor.

```js
/**
 * Executes all tests for each defined viewport.
 * @param {string} title - The describe block title.
 * @param {string[]} viewports - A list of viewports. [tiny, small, medium, large, huge, enormous]
 * @param {function} fn - The block of tests to execute against each viewport.
 */
Terra.describeViewports(title, [viewports], fn);
```

<Notice variant="caution" ariaLevel="5">

  Describe helpers should not be nested within other describe helpers.

</Notice>

```js
// The following example will scope the tests to run only for the `tiny` and `huge` form factors. The tests will not run for any other form factor.

Terra.describeViewports('Describe viewports title', ['tiny', 'huge'], () => {
  it('should test tiny and huge screens', () => {
    browser.url('/testing/route/');

    Terra.validates.screenshot('describe viewports');
  });
});

// Multiple describe helpers can be used sequentially in the same spec file as long as they are not nested.

Terra.describeViewports('Describe viewports title', ['small'], () => {
  it('should test small screens', () => {
    browser.url('/testing/route/small/');

    Terra.validates.screenshot('describe viewports');
  });
});
```

#### Terra.describeTests

The `Terra.describeTests` helper extends the `Terra.describeViewports` helper by additionally filtering tests by locale and theme. Tests within this helper will only be executed if each of the form factors, locales, and themes listed in the options match those defined in the configurations for the current test run. If no form factors, locales, or themes are provided as options, then all tests under this helper will qualify to run in any form factor, locale, or theme.

```js
/**
 * Executes all tests for each defined set of form factors, locales, and themes.
 * @param {string} title - The describe block title.
 * @param {Object} options - An object containing arrays of formFactors, locales, and themes that the block of tests will only qualify to execute in.
 * @param {string} options.formFactors - The form factors that the block of tests only execute in.
 * @param {string} options.locales -  The language locales that the block of tests only execute in.
 * @param {string} options.themes - The themes that the block of tests only execute in.
 * @param {function} fn - The block of tests to execute based on the defined form factor, locale, and theme.
 */
Terra.describeTests(title, options, fn);
```

The following tests will only be ran for the locales, themes, and form factors provided:

<Notice variant="caution" ariaLevel="5">

  The describe helper should not be nested inside of another describe helper.

</Notice>

```js
const testOptions = {
  formFactors: ['tiny', 'huge'],
  locales: ['en', 'fr'],
  themes: ['terra-default-theme', 'orion-fusion-theme']
}

Terra.describeTests('Describe tests', testOptions, () => {
  it('should execute only if form factor is tiny or huge, locale is en or fr, and theme is terra-default-theme or orion-fusion-theme', () => {
    browser.url('/testing/route/');
    Terra.validates.element('describe tests');
  });
});
```

### Accessibility Testing

The testing library integrates [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) into the testing framework to help automate accessibility testing along side functional testing.

Axe will analyze the entire document when run and report accessibility violations. The following [tags](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/API.md#axe-core-tags) are enabled: `wcag2a`, `wcag2aa`, `wcag21aa`, and `section508`. Each tag has an associated list of [rules](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/rule-descriptions.md) that will be checked against the document when axe is run.

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="4">

  Please note that not all accessibility testing can be automated. Axe provides a lightweight static analysis of the entire document to catch common accessibility violations, but it is the responsibility of each team and application to do thorough accessibility and functional testing manually when necessary.

</Notice>

#### Terra.validates.accessibility

The validates accessibility command will run accessibility checks on the entire document. If accessibility violations are found the test step will fail. It is recommended to run accessibility checks at various steps in a functional workflow to check for violations at different stages of the application.

<Notice variant="caution" ariaLevel="4">

  The accessibility assertion must be used within an `it` block.

</Notice>

```js
it('should report no accessibility violations', () => {
  browser.url('/testing/route/');

  Terra.validates.accessibility(); // Fails if accessibility violations are found anywhere on the document.
});
```

The accessibility assertion accepts [options](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/API.md#options-parameter) that will be passed to axe for the document analysis.

```js
it('should override a rule configuration', () => {
  browser.url('/testing/route/');

  // Rule override for this specific test.
  const options = { rules: { 'color-contrast': { enabled: false } } };

  Terra.validates.accessibility(options);
});
```

### Screenshot Testing

A screenshot can be captured at any given point inside an `it` block in a test. The element(s) being captured in the screenshot is determined by the provided selector option or the default `[data-terra-test-content]` selector if one is not provided. If part or all of the selector or any of its children are rendered outside the bounds of the current viewport, only what is within the viewport will be captured and what is outside the viewport will be clipped. The captured screenshot will be used as a reference artifact. Element validation is done by comparing the reference screenshot against the screenshot captured in future test runs at the same point in the test.

#### Terra.validates.screenshot

Invoking the assertion will capture a screenshot at the time it is invoked. If no reference screenshot exists, one will be created in the `reference` folder with the given screenshot name. If such reference screenshot already exists, the new screenshot will be compared with the reference screenshot to validate visually that they are within the mismatch tolerance. If the mismatch exceeds the tolerance, the test step will fail and a screenshot showing the difference will be generated.

<Notice variant="caution" ariaLevel="5">

  The screenshot assertion must be used within an `it` block and a screenshot name must be provided.

</Notice>

```js
it('should validate the screenshot', () => {
  browser.url('/testing/route/');

  Terra.validates.screenshot('screenshot-name'); // Fails if the new screenshot doesn't visually match the reference screenshot.
});
```

The screenshot naming pattern is as follows:

```js
base_directory/test_spec_directory/test_spec_name/__snapshots__/(reference|latest|diff)/theme/locale/browserName_terraViewportName/screenshot-name.png
```

The screenshot assertion accepts an optional second argument with the following keys.
  * `selector` - The element selector to use to capture the element for screenshot comparison. The default selector is `data-terra-test-content`.
  * `mismatchTolerance` - The number between 0 and 100 that defines the degree of mismatch to consider two images as identical. Increasing this value will decrease level of test coverage. The default mismatch tolerance is 0.01.

```js
it('should validate the screenshot with options', () => {
  browser.url('/testing/route/');

  const options = {
    selector: '#element-id',
    mismatchTolerance: 10,
  };

  Terra.validates.screenshot('screenshot-name', options);
});
```

#### Terra.validates.element

The validates element assertion performs both accessibility and screenshot assertions.

<Notice variant="caution" ariaLevel="5">

  The validates element assertion must be used within an `it` block and a screenshot name must be provided.

</Notice>

```js
it('should validate the element', () => {
  browser.url('/testing/route/');

  Terra.validates.element('screenshot-name'); // Fails if the new screenshot doesn't visually match the reference screenshot.
});
```

The element assertion accepts an optional second argument with the following keys.
  * `rules` - The accessibility [rules](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/master/doc/rule-descriptions.md) to use as overrides if necessary.
  * `selector` - The element selector to use to capture the element for screenshot comparison. The default selector is `data-terra-test-content`.
  * `mismatchTolerance` - The number between 0 and 100 that defines the degree of mismatch to consider two images as identical. Increasing this value will decrease level of test coverage. The default mismatch tolerance is 0.01.

```js
it('should validate the element with options', () => {
  browser.url('/testing/route/');

  const options = {
    rules: { 'color-contrast': { enabled: false } },
    selector: '#element-id',
    mismatchTolerance: 10,
  };

  Terra.validates.element('screenshot-name', options);
});
```

### Additional Utilities

#### Terra.hideInputCaret

An editable text field in focus will have a blinking caret. Often times this blinking caret causes inconsistent test failures due to the blinking of the caret during screenshot capture. This situation can be avoided by using `Terra.hideInputCaret` to set the CSS caret color to of the element to be transparent. This method must be placed in a `before`, `beforeEach`, or `it` block or it will not be ran. This method accepts a selector string as an argument and will only apply to the first selector if multiple are found. The caret will automatically be hidden for body every time the page loads or refreshes.

```js
it('should hide the caret', () => {
  Terra.hideInputCaret('#inputID');
  const element = browser.element('#inputID');

  expect(element.getCSSProperty('caretColor').value).toEqual('rgba(0,0,0,0)');
});
```

#### Terra.setApplicationLocale

Use `Terra.setApplicationLocale` to update a terra application's locale on a case by case basis; particularly useful for testing locale changes on a deployed application. This method accepts a string containing the `locale` to update to.

```js
it('should update an application's locale, () => {
  Terra.setApplicationLocale('en');
});
```

## Remote Screenshots Migration

<Notice variant="important" ariaLevel="3">

  The Remote Screenshots Mirgation feature currently only supports internal projects built using Jenkins at Cerner Corporation. Open source projects that utilize other CI such as Travis is not supported.

</Notice>

WebdriverIO reference screenshots used for screenshot comparison during testing are stored in the `tests/wdio/__snapshots__/reference` folder. Large projects with many test steps require to capture a large set of screenshots. Storing a large set of screenshots locally in the project will greatly increase the size of the project and can degrade performance when cloning and building the project.
Terra Functional Tessting offers a feature to migrate all reference screenshots stored in your project to a remote repository named Nexus. As a result screenshots will no longer be stored in the project and committed to github. This will reduce the project size and improve performance.

### Workflows

- Branch Build - For a typical branch build in Jenkins triggered either manually, by a nightly job, or from a downstream build, the reference screenshots will be downloaded from Nexus. Latest screenshots generated during the test will compare against the downloaded reference screenshots. Should there be screenshot mismatches the build will fail the same way as it does before. Latest sccreenshots generated by this type of build will never be uploaded to Nexus.
- Pull Request Build - Intentional changes in a project can alter wdio screenshots. Like the branch build, a pull request build will also download the reference screenshots from Nexus for comparison. Unlike the branch build, should screenshot mistmaches occur the pull request build will not fail because often times the mismatches are expected due to the intentional change in the pull request. When there are screenshot mismatches, an alert will be displayed in the pull request to indicate the situation and suggest to review the mismatches to verify the mismatches are expected. Latest sccreenshots generated by this type of build will never be uploaded to Nexus.
- Pull Request Merge Build - After a pull request is merged to a base branch, a build will be triggered for the branch. Screenshots will also be downloaded from Nexus for comparisons. Should there be screenshot mismatches, the build will not fail because any mismatch is expected to have already been verified during the pull request build. The latest screenshots generated by this build will be uploaded to Nexus and replace the existing reference screenshots that were previosly uploaded.

2) To use this feature add and set the `useRemoteReferenceScreenshots` parameter to `true` for the ionNPM pipeline. This feature will not be used if the existing `runWdio` parameter is set to `false` because it is applicable only when WDIO tests need to run.

Jenkinsfile
```diff
library "ion-jenkins"

ionNPM {
  formFactors = ['small', 'huge']
  locales=['en']
  runWdio = true
+  useRemoteReferenceScreenshots = true
  useSeleniumGrid = true
}
```

#### wdio.conf.js
3) There are two supported sites where screenshots can be stored: `main-site` and `internal-site`. Projects that are expected to be released and used in a production environment should be stored in the Main repository. Projects or tools that are expected to be mainly used internally for development should be stored in the Internal repository. Configure your project's `wdio.conf.js` to add the `repositoryId` and `repositoryUrl` of the remote site where the screenshots should be stored.

Main repository
```diff
const { config } = require('@cerner/terra-functional-testing');

+ config.screenshotsSites = {
+   repositoryId: 'cerner-release-main-site',
+   repositoryUrl: 'http://repo.release.cerner.corp/nexus/service/local/repositories/main-site',
+ };

exports.config = config;
```

Internal repository
```diff
const { config } = require('@cerner/terra-functional-testing');

+ config.screenshotsSites = {
+   repositoryId: 'cerner-release-internal-site',
+   repositoryUrl: 'http://repo.release.cerner.corp/nexus/service/local/repositories/internal-site',
+ };

exports.config = config;
```

#### /tests/wdio/__snapshots__/reference
4) When migrating a project's screenshots to Nexus for the very first time, it is important to run the WDIO tests locally to ensure that the latest genenerated screenshots from the wdio test run are what is expected. The reason is because there is no existing reference screenshots in Nexus to use as the base reference screenshots for the very first time. Every time when a pull request is issued for changes made in your project, all reference screenshots will be regenerated and uploaded to repository in Nexus during the merge build in Jenkins when the pull request is merged. Therefore, all screenshots currently stored in the `reference` directory can be safely deleted.

#### .gitignore
5) Reference screenshots should no longer be stored in github. Similar to the `diff`, `error`, and `latest` screenshot directories, add the `reference` directory to avoid checking in the reference screenshots.

Internal repository
```diff
**/__snapshots__/diff
**/__snapshots__/error
**/__snapshots__/latest
+  **/__snapshots__/reference
```

### Local Development After Screenshots Have Been Migrated

#### Without Nexus Authentication
Authentication is required to download and upload screenshots to Nexus. If you do not want to setup authentication to download the screenshot from Nexus for development and running wdio tests locally, you can let terra-functional-testing auto generate the screenshots during the test run and use these newly generated screenshots as reference. After you clone your project and before development begins, you first need to run the tests as is to regenerate all reference screenshots based on the current code. Development and testing can continue as usual.

#### With Nexus Authentication
You will need to have credentials set up in order to download screenshots from Nexus.

1) Request access to [ion-jenkins-private](https://github.cerner.com/ion-server-core/ion-jenkins-private).
2) Copy the [ROLL_OUT_RELEASE_CREDENTIALS.yml](https://github.cerner.com/ion-server-core/ion-jenkins-private/blob/master/ROLL_OUT_RELEASE_CREDENTIALS.yml) file. Name it `.roll_out.yml` and place it in your home directory.
3) Add the `useRemoteReferenceScreenshots` CLI option to your wdio test script in package.json
```diff
-  "test:wdio": "terra wdio",
+  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --useRemoteReferenceScreenshots",
```
4) Run the wdio tests as usual. When the useRemoteReferenceScreenshots option set, the screenshots in Nexus will be downloaded at the beginning of the test run.
