# Terra Toolkit Wdio Helpers

## Wdio Runner
Terra Toolkit offers its own wdio test runner which runs wdio test runs for specified locales and form factors. This allows for locale test runs that can match parallelized container test runs by synchronously running the wdio for each test run variation. This runner is a replacement for webdriverio's bin script `wdio` by directly calling webdriverio's test launcher module for each test variation.

Terra's wdio test runner is available via the `tt-wdio` cli or the `wdio-runner` javascript function.

Before running this script, it is recommended you pack the static site in production mode and add the relative path to the `site` key in the wdio configuration. This would only be desired for locally testing with this script.

#### API
Run ```tt-wdio --help``` to see the configuration options.

If no config is supplied to `tt-wdio`, `tt-wdio` will first search for `wdio.conf.js` in the working directory. If that is not found, it will attempt to use the default wdio config supplied by terra-dev-site.

#### CLI Usage
In your package.json
```JSON
{
  "pack": "NODE_ENV=production webpack --config ./webpack.config.js -p",
  "test:wdio-locally": "npm run pack; tt-wdio --config ./wdio.conf.js --locales ['en','es']; rm -rf ./build"
}
```

#### Function Usage
In your code
```
const runner = require('terra-toolkit/scripts/wdio/wdio-runner');

runner({
  configPath: './wdio.conf.js',
  continueOnFail: true,
  locales: ['en', 'es'],
  browsers: ['chrome', 'firefox'],
});
```

## Wdio Screenshot Cleanup
Terra Toolkit offers a screenshot cleanup tool to remove `errorScreenshots`, `latest`, `diff` and, if indicated, `reference` screenshots. This is available via the `tt-clean-screenshots` cli or the `clean-screenshots` javascript function.

`tt-wdio` will call this before calling its test runner, such that the generated screenshot within your project are from the only the latest test run(s).

#### API
Run ```tt-clean-screenshots --help``` to see the configuration options.

If no config is supplied to `tt-clean-screenshots`, `tt-clean-screenshots` will first search for `wdio.conf.js` in the working directory. If that is not found, it will attempt to use the default wdio config supplied by terra-dev-site.

#### CLI Usage
```JSON
{
  "clean-screenshots": "tt-clean-screenshots"
}
```

#### Function Usage
```
const cleanScreenshots = require('terra-toolkit/scripts/wdio/clean-screenshots');

cleanScreenshots();
```
