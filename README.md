Terra Toolkit is a utility module used to facilitate independent development of Terra projects. This toolkit provides configuration and helpers needed for nightwatch testing to streamline development of npm packages. [terra-core][@terra-core] and [terra-clinical][@terra-clinical] are two example mono-repos which are utilizing utilities offered in this package.

## Getting Started

- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com): `npm install terra-toolkit --save-dev`


## Nightwatch Utility
Nightwatch.js is an easy to use Node.js based End-to-End (E2E) testing solution for browser based apps and websites. It uses the powerful W3C WebDriver API to perform commands and assertions on DOM elements. Full documentation regarding nightwatch can be found at http://nightwatchjs.org/.


### Configuration Setup

Terra-toolkit provides a nightwatch setup function, called `nightwatchConfig`, which provides the nightwatch configuration needed to setup the test environment, launch the webpack-dev-server, and run the nightwatch tests. It takes three parameters:

1. the webpack configuration used to start the webpack-dev-server
2. the src folders where nightwatch searches for the tests
3. [optional] the port number to start the webpack-dev-server - defaults to port 8080


Terra-toolkit provides the setup helper, `getPackageTestDirectories`, to aggregate all mono-repo package test folders when its supplied with the repository's `lerna.json` file. Note: this helper does assumes the package structure is 'package_name/tests/nightwatch'.

```javascript
// An example of a mono-repo configuration file:
const nightwatchConfig = require('terra-toolkit/lib/nightwatch/nightwatch.config.js').default;
const webpackConfig = require('./webpack.config');
const getPackageTestDirectories = require('terra-toolkit/lib/nightwatch/setup-helper.js').getPackageTestDirectories;

let srcFolders;
const isRepoTest = !process.cwd().includes('/packages/');

if (isRepoTest) {
  srcFolders = getPackageTestDirectories('lerna.json');
} else {
  srcFolders = 'tests/nightwatch/';
}

const config = nightwatchConfig(webpackConfig, srcFolders, 9000);

module.exports = config;
```


### Writing Tests

There are a few things to note about the nightwatch configuration generated by Terra-Toolkit:

- Test files should use `*-spec.js` naming format. The generated configuration filters on `**/*-spec.js`.
- An after test hook is provided which calls the nightwatch `.end()` function.
- Use `${browser.launchUrl}/#/test_url_path` to direct test urls. The generated configuration sets the launchUrl to `http://localhost:${port}`.
- [ChromeDriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver) is the default testing environment and it's default browser size is 800x600.

To assist with testing various browser sizes, Terra-toolkit provides the responsive test helpers, `resizeTo` and `screenWidth`.
- `resizeTo` wraps the nightwatch test suite and handles browser resizing on the breakpoints provided. The breakpoint options, `tiny`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `huge`, and `enormous`, represent the screen widths tested; these correspond to the screen widths of 470px, 622px, 838px, 1000px, 1300px, and 1500px respectively.
- `screenWidth` returns the current screen width. This helper must be used in conjunction with `resizeTo`.

```javascript
const { resizeTo, screenWidth } = require('terra-tookit/lib/nightwatch/responsive-helpers');

module.exports = resizeTo(['tiny', 'small', 'medium', 'large', 'huge', 'enormous'], {
  'Static test path one renders correctly': (browser) => {
    browser.url(`${browser.launchUrl}/#/test-path-1`);
    browser.expect.element('.test').text.to.equal('Test');
  },

  'Responsive test path two renders correctly': (browser) => {
    browser.url(`${browser.launchUrl}/#/test-path-2`);
    const width = screenWidth(browser);

    if (width <= browser.globals.breakpoints.tiny[0]) {
      browser.expect.element('.test').text.to.equal('Tiny Response');
    } else {
      browser.expect.element('.test').text.to.equal('Default Response');
    }
  },
});
```

Finally, it is **highly recommended** to use the expect API over the assert API. Expect is a Behavior Driven Development interface which aligns more appropriately with react renderings and interactions.

#### Writing Tests with ChromeDriver:
 - ChromeDriver clicks the center of an element.
 - ChromeDriver cannot click moving objects. More information [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/help/clicking-issues).
 - ChromeDriver's clearValue functions correctly, but does not trigger a change for an element.

### Running Tests
Installation of the terra-toolkit will install a global reference to Nightwatch, providing access to the nightwatch test runner. The nightwatch test runner requires a configuration file to be passed either from the current directory or via the `--config` or `-c` followed by the config path.

```javascript
// Script at the root-level of a mono-repo with config in same directory
"nightwatch": "nightwatch";

// Script at a package-level of a mono-repo
"nightwatch": "$(cd ..; npm bin)/nightwatch -c ../../nightwatch.conf.js";
```

## Versioning

Terra-toolkit is considered to be stable and will follow [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
1. MAJOR versions represent breaking changes
2. MINOR versions represent added functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
3. PATCH versions represent backwards-compatible bug fixes
