# Docker Service

The docker service initializes a docker swarm for running functional [WebDriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) tests against a containerized [selenium docker](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium) environment.

By default, the selenium grid will be deployed locally on the host machine running on port 4444. Google Chrome and Firefox browsers are available on the grid.
