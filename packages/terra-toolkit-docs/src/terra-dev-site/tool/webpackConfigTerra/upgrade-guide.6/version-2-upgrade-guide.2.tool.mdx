# webpack-config-terra Upgrade Guide

## Changes from @cerner/webpack-config-terra 1.0.0 to @cerner/webpack-config-terra 2.0.0

#### Removed node-sass

We have removed `node-sass` from dependencies and switched to `sass (dart-sass)`.

#### Update WDIO snapshots

The previously used `node-sass` had a precision of 5, whereas `sass` has an unadjustable precision of 10. Hence it is required for all the users upgrading to @cerner/webpack-config-terra 2.0.0 to update their WDIO snapshots.
