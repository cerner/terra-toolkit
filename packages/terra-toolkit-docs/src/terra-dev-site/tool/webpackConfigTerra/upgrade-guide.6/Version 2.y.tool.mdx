# webpack-config-terra Upgrade Guide

## Changes from @cerner/webpack-config-terra 1.0.0 to @cerner/webpack-config-terra 2.0.0

#### Removed Polyfill entrypoints

In an effort to provide more direct control to consumers we have removed the core-js and regenerator runtime polyfills from webpack-config-terra. Consumers can now decide if those polyfills are required for their sites. We now offer the [terra-polyfill](/application/cerner-terra-application-docs/polyfills) package that can be included in your application as a side effect.

```js
import '@cerner/terra-polyfill';
```

#### Removed node-sass

We have removed [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) from dependencies and switched to [sass (dart-sass)](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass).

#### Update WDIO snapshots

The previously used `node-sass` had a precision of 5, whereas `sass` has an unadjustable precision of 10. Hence consumers may need to regenerate screenshots to account for slightly larger css values.
