# Theme Aggregation

Terra Toolkit provides a built-in mechanism for aggregating themes.

By default, the terra-toolkit webpack configuration enables theme aggregation when it detects the presence of a `terra-theme.config.js` file.

## Getting started

Create a new file within the same directory as your webpack configuration file.

The file must be named `terra-theme.config.js`.

```
project
├── terra-theme.config.js
├── webpack.config.js
```

Within this file declare and export an object containing your theme configuration.

This configuration will be used to aggregate nested dependency themes and output a single `aggregated-themes.js` file. This file will be automatically included as an entry point within your application if you are using the webpack configuration provided by terra-toolkit.

Theme files must follow naming conventions to be aggregated. Theme files are expected be within a namespaced directory within a `themes` directory.

```txt
project
└── themes
    ├── terra-dark-theme
    │   ├── component.scss
    │   ├── root-theme.scss
    │   └── scoped-theme.scss
    └── terra-light-theme
        ├── component.scss
        ├── root-theme.scss
        └── scoped-theme.scss
```

### Root Theme Example

The `root-theme.scss` file should include all the necessary imports for the theme.

```scss
@import 'component-1.scss';
@import 'component-2.scss';
```

### Scoped Theme Example

The `scoped-theme.scss` file should include a selector to enable a scoping.

```scss
$selector: '.terra-dark-theme';
@import 'root-theme';
```

## Configuration

### terra-theme.config.js

```js
const themeConfig = {
  exclude: [], // Files to exclude. Accepts glob patterns.
  theme: 'terra-dark-theme', // The default theme.
  scoped: ['terra-light-theme', 'terra-lowlight-theme'], // An array of scoped themes.
};

module.exports = themeConfig;
```

### Options

#### Exclude (Optional)

The `exclude` option accepts an array of files to exclude from being aggregated.

#### Theme (Optional)

The `theme` option accepts the string name of a default theme. The default theme will be applied directly to the application. If a `root-theme.scss` is found only that single file will be aggregated.

#### Scoped (Optional)

The `scoped` option accepts an array of theme names to aggregate. Only the `scoped-theme.scss` files will be aggregated.
