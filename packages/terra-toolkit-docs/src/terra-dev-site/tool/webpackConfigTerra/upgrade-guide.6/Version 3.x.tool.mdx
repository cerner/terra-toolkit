# webpack-config-terra Upgrade Guide

## Changes from @cerner/webpack-config-terra 2.0.0 to @cerner/webpack-config-terra 3.0.0

#### Updated Webpack-Dev-Server from version 3 to verison 4

Webpack-dev-server has been updated to latest version 4.x. This update will fix hot reloading issue on development mode which was stopped working after upgrading Webpack to verison 5

#### Breaking Changes
Webpack-dev-server version 3 will not work with webpack-config-terra version 3.0.0. the webpack-dev-server has replaced the configuration options ( listed below ) in it's latest version v4, this changes will cause webpack-dev-server v3 configurations to fail with webpack-config-terra v3.
- `inline` has been removed without replacement in webpack-dev-server v4.
- `stats`, `index` and `publicPath` has been moved to `devMiddleware` option.

Updating webpack-config-terra to version 3.0.0 would require consuming projects to update webpack-dev-server to version 4 in their local dependencies.
```diff
  "devDependencies": {
-   "webpack-dev-server": "^3.x.x"
+   "webpack-dev-server": "^4.7.2"
