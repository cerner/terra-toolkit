# Logger

`terra-cli` provides a logger for use when creating cli tools. It is built on top of the [npm logger](https://github.com/npm/npmlog) and supports all log levels that the npm logger supports. It automatically provides a `terra` heading to group terra cli commands in one namespace and a `prefix` prop to group all logs from a given file together.

## Example

The following will log at the info level.

```
const { Logger } = require('@cerner/terra-cli');

const logger = new Logger({ prefix: '[test-logger]' });

logger.info('Logging something at the info level');
```
