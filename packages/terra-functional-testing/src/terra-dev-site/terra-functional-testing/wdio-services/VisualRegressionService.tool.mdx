# Visual Regression Service

> Visual regression testing for WebdriverIO

Based on the work of Jan-Andr√© Zinser on [wdio-visual-regression-service](https://github.com/zinserjan/wdio-visual-regression-service) and [wdio-screenshot](https://github.com/zinserjan/wdio-screenshot)

## Installation

The wdio-visual-regression-service should be installed as a dev-dependency:

```sh
$ npm install @cerner/terra-functional-testing --save-dev
```

## Configuration
Setup wdio-visual-regression-service by adding `visual-regression` to the service section of your WebdriverIO config and define your desired comparison strategy in the service options.

```js
// wdio.conf.js

var path = require('path');
var VisualRegressionCompare = require('@cerner/terra-functional-testing/lib/services/wdio-visual-regression-service/compare');

exports.config = {
  // ...
  services: [
    [
      'visual-regression',
      {
        baseScreenshotDir: process.cwd(),
        locale: 'en',
        theme: 'terra-default-theme',
      }
    ]
  ],
  // ...
};
```

### Options
Under the key `visualRegression` in your wdio.config.js you can pass a configuration object with the following structure:

* **baseScreenshotDir** `String` ( default: process.cwd() ) <br />
pass in a string with the custom base output directory screenshots should be saved to.

* **locale** `String` ( default: 'en' ) <br />
the locale the test runner is testing against. This is used to categorizes screenshots by locale.

* **theme** `String` ( default: 'terra-default-theme' ) <br />
the theme the test runner is testing against. This is used to categorizes screenshots by theme.

### Compare Methods
wdio-visual-regression-service allows the usage of different screenshot comparison methods.

#### VisualRegressionCompare.LocalCompare
The *LocalCompare* method captures screenshots on your computer and compares a reference screenshot against the latest (current) screenshots captured in the test run. If a mismatch occurs, a diff screenshot will be outputed. This is the compare method used by the VisualRegressionService.

The screenshot naming pattern is as follows:

```js
baseScreenshotDir/test_spec_directory/test_spec_name/__snapshots__/(reference|latest|diff)/theme/locale/browserName_terraViewportName/screenshot.png
```

You can pass the following options to it's constructor as object:

* **baseScreenshotDir** `String` ( default: process.cwd() ) <br />
pass in a string with the custom base output directory screenshots should be saved to.

* **locale** `String` ( default: 'en' ) <br />
the locale the test runner is testing against. This is used to categorize screenshots by locale.

* **theme** `String` ( default: 'terra-default-theme' ) <br />
the theme the test runner is testing against. This is used to categorize screenshots by theme.

For an example of generating screenshot filenames dependent on the current test name, have a look at the sample code of [Configuration](#configuration).

#### VisualRegressionCompare.SaveScreenshot
This method is a stripped variant of `VisualRegressionCompare.LocalCompare` to capture only screenshots. This is quite useful when you just want to create reference screenshots and overwrite the previous one without diffing.

You can pass the following options to it's constructor as object:

* **screenshotName** `Function` <br />
pass in a function that returns the filename for the current screenshot. Function receives a *context* object as first parameter with all relevant information about the command.

## Usage
wdio-visual-regression-service enhances an WebdriverIO instance with the following commands:
* `browser.checkViewport([{options}]);`
* `browser.checkDocument([{options}]);`
* `browser.checkElement(elementSelector, [{options}]);`

All of these provide options that will help you to capture screenshots in different dimensions or to exclude irrelevant parts (e.g. content). The following options are
available:

* **exclude** `String[]|Object[]` (**not yet implemented**)<br />
  exclude frequently changing parts of your screenshot, you can either pass all kinds of different [WebdriverIO selector strategies](http://webdriver.io/guide/usage/selectors.html)
  that queries one or multiple elements or you can define x and y values which stretch a rectangle or polygon

* **hide** `Object[]`<br />
  hides all elements queried by all kinds of different [WebdriverIO selector strategies](http://webdriver.io/guide/usage/selectors.html) (via `visibility: hidden`)

* **remove** `Object[]`<br />
  removes all elements queried by all kinds of different [WebdriverIO selector strategies](http://webdriver.io/guide/usage/selectors.html) (via `display: none`)

* **misMatchTolerance** `Number` <br />
    Overrides the global *misMatchTolerance* value for this command. Pass in a number between 0 and 100 that defines the degree of mismatch to consider two images as identical.

* **ignoreComparison** `String` <br />
    Overrides the global *ignoreComparison* value for this command. Pass in a string with value of `nothing` , `colors` or `antialiasing` to adjust the comparison method.
