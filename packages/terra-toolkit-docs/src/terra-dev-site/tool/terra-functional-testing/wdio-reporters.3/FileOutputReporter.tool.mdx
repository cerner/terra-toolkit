# Wdio File Output Reporter

Wdio File Output Reporter is a reporter that logs wdio test output to separate files based on locale, theme, and form-factor with the following attributes

- Date and time of when the tests are started and when they are finished

- Locale, Form Factor, Theme, and Cloud Region (if provided by full stack wdio configuration) of the tests

- Name of the tests and whether they've succeeded or failed

**WDIO test output Directory**
Wdio File Output Reporter logs the WDIO test output in tests/wdio/reports/

**Check for Mono Repo**
Wdio File Output Reporter assumes mono-repo will have packages directory in the root folder
