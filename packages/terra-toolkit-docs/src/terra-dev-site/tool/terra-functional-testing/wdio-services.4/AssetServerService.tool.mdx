# Asset Server Service

The asset server service initializes an asset server to serve compiled assets to the testing environment. An express server will be launched for static sites. For all non-static sites a webpack-dev-server will be launched.

## Options

The assert server options are configured via the [test runner CLI options](../about#options). The webpack-dev-server will be provided the locale and theme options via the test runner and will pass those through to webpack.

### assetServerPort

The port the service will be hosted on.

Type: `number`

Required: `false`

Default: `8080`

Example:

```js
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --assetServerPort 8081"
}
```

### site

A relative path to a directory of static assets. If provided, an express server will be launched to serve the directory assets.

Note: The `site` configuration option will take precedence over `webpackConfig` if both are provided.

Type: `string`

Required: `false`

Default: `undefined`

Example:

```js
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --site ./build"
}
```
