# Asset Server Service

The asset server service initializes an asset server to serve compiled assets to the testing environment. An express server will be launched for static sites. For all non-static sites a webpack-dev-server will be launched.

## Options

The assert server options are configured via the [test runner CLI options](../about#options). The webpack-dev-server will be provided the locale and theme options via the test runner and will pass those through to webpack.

### asset-server-port

The port the service will be hosted on.

Type: `number`

Required: `false`

Default: `8080`

Example:

```js
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --asset-server-port 8081"
}
```

### disable-server

This will disable the internal webpack and express server and instead will try to connect to an existing server.
This is useful for local development where a single dev-server can be used for local browser tesing and running wdio tests.
By default, the test runner will connect to `0.0.0.0:8080`. The port and url can be configured with the `--external-host` and `--external-port` flags. 

Type: `boolean`

Required: `false`

Default: `false`

Example:

```js
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --disable-server"
}
```

### site

A relative path to a directory of static assets. If provided, an express server will be launched to serve the directory assets.

Note: The `site` configuration option will take precedence over `webpackConfig` if both are provided.

Type: `string`

Required: `false`

Default: `undefined`

Example:

```js
"scripts": {
  "test:wdio": "terra wdio --site ./build"
}
```
